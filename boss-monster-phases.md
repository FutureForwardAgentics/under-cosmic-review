# Boss Monster Game Phases

## How to Win
- **Win the game:** Be the first player to collect 10 Souls at the end of any turn
- **Lose the game:** Get 5 Wounds at the end of any turn

## The 5 Phases (In Order)

### Phase 1: Beginning of Turn
**What happens automatically:**
- Reveal one Hero card for each player in the game
- Each player draws one Room card from the deck

**What players CAN do:**
- Nothing - just watch and draw

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play Spell cards
- Use Room abilities
- Build anything

---

### Phase 2: Build Phase
**What players CAN do:**
- Build exactly one Room card (optional - you can skip if you want)
- Place the Room face-down to the left of your other rooms, OR place it on top of an existing room to upgrade
- Play Spell cards that have the Build icon (hammer symbol)
- Use Room abilities that have the Build icon (hammer symbol)

**Turn order:**
- Players take turns based on XP (highest XP goes first)
- Each player places their room face-down
- After everyone is done, flip all new rooms face-up at the same time

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Build more than one Room per turn
- Play Spells without the Build icon

---

### Phase 3: Bait Phase
**What happens automatically:**
- Each Hero looks at all the dungeons
- Each Hero goes to the entrance of the dungeon with the most matching Treasure icons
- If there's a tie, or nobody has that Treasure type, the Hero stays in town (doesn't go anywhere)

**What players CAN do:**
- Watch the Heroes move to dungeons

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play any Spell cards
- Use any abilities
- Influence where Heroes go (it's automatic based on Treasure)

---

### Phase 4: Adventure Phase
**What happens:**
- Each Hero walks through the dungeon they entered
- The Hero takes damage from every Room in the dungeon (left to right)
- Compare the Hero's Health to the total damage:
  - If damage is equal to or more than Health: The Hero dies and becomes a Soul (good for you!)
  - If damage is less than Health: The Hero survives and becomes a Wound (bad for you!)

**Turn order:**
- Players take turns based on XP (highest XP goes first)
- When it's your turn, you process all the Heroes at your dungeon entrance

**What players CAN do:**
- Play Spell cards that have the Adventure icon (axe symbol)
- Use Room abilities that have the Adventure icon (axe symbol)

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play Spells without the Adventure icon
- Change the order Heroes go through your dungeon

---

### Phase 5: End of Turn
**What happens automatically:**
- All "until end of turn" effects stop working
- Any deactivated (sideways) rooms turn back upright
- Check if anyone won or lost the game
- If the game isn't over, start a new turn at Phase 1

**What players CAN do:**
- Nothing - just clean up and get ready for the next turn

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play Spell cards
- Use abilities

## Glossary

### Game Terms

**Active Player**
The player whose turn it is right now. In Build and Adventure phases, players take turns being the active player.

**Adventure Phase**
The phase where Heroes travel through dungeons and take damage. Heroes who die become Souls; Heroes who survive become Wounds.

**Advanced Room**
A more powerful room card that can only be built on top of another room (as an upgrade). Advanced rooms are stronger than ordinary rooms.

**Bait**
The process where Heroes are attracted to dungeons based on Treasure icons. The dungeon with the most matching Treasure "baits" the Hero.

**Boss**
Your main character card. Each Boss has an XP value and a special Level Up ability. The Boss card sits at the right end of your dungeon.

**Build**
To play a room card from your hand. You can build to the left of your existing rooms, or build on top of a room to upgrade it.

**Damage**
The amount of hurt a room deals to a Hero. Damage is shown as a number on the room card.

**Deactivate**
To turn a card sideways. Deactivated rooms stay sideways until the End of Turn phase, when they turn back upright.

**Destroy**
To remove a room card from play permanently. Destroyed cards go to the discard pile and can't be used again.

**Discard**
To remove a card from your hand and put it in the discard pile. When told to discard, you usually choose which card unless the effect says otherwise.

**Dungeon**
All the rooms you have built, from left to right, ending with your Boss card. Heroes enter at the left and move right through your dungeon.

**Entrance**
The area to the left of your leftmost room. This is where Heroes wait before entering your dungeon.

**Epic Hero**
A powerful Hero card worth 2 Souls if defeated, or 2 Wounds if they survive. Epic Heroes have higher health than ordinary Heroes.

**Face-Down**
When a card is placed with its back showing. Face-down cards keep their information hidden until they're revealed.

**Health**
The amount of damage a Hero can take before dying. If a Hero takes damage equal to or greater than their health, they die.

**Heal**
To turn a Wound (face-up Hero card) into a Soul (face-down Hero card). Healing removes the penalty of a Wound.

**Hero**
Character cards that try to get through your dungeon. If they die, you get Souls. If they survive, you get Wounds.

**Level Up**
A special one-time ability your Boss can use when you build 5 rooms. Each Boss has a unique Level Up ability.

**Ordinary Hero**
A regular Hero card worth 1 Soul if defeated, or 1 Wound if they survive. Most Heroes are ordinary.

**Ordinary Room**
A basic room card that can be built in any empty space in your dungeon.

**Room**
A card that makes up your dungeon. Rooms deal damage to Heroes and show Treasure icons to attract Heroes.

**Soul**
A Hero you defeated. Souls are face-down Hero cards. Get 10 Souls to win the game.

**Spell**
A special card you can play for one-time effects. Spells have icons showing when they can be played (Build or Adventure phase).

**Treasure**
Icons on room cards that attract Heroes. There are four types: Science (🔬), Dramatic (🎭), Corporate (💼), and Government (🎖️).

**Wound**
A Hero who survived your dungeon. Wounds are face-up Hero cards. Get 5 Wounds and you lose the game.

**XP (Experience Points)**
The number on your Boss card that determines turn order. Higher XP goes first in Build and Adventure phases.

## Important Notes

**XP Order:** In phases where turn order matters (Build and Adventure), the player with the highest XP value goes first. If there's a tie, the tied players decide among themselves who goes first.

**Spell Icons:**
- Hammer icon = can use during Build Phase
- Axe icon = can use during Adventure Phase

**Room Abilities:** Follow the same icon rules as Spells

**Ties in Bait Phase:** If two players have the same Treasure value, the Hero doesn't move to either dungeon - it stays in town.

**Advanced Rooms:** Can only be built by placing them on top of an existing room that matches their upgrade requirement.

**Epic Heroes:** Worth 2 Souls if defeated or 2 Wounds if they survive (double the normal value).
