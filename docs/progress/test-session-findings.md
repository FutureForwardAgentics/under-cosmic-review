# Test Session Findings - Under Cosmic Review
## Date: 2025-09-30

### Test Overview
Conducted automated game simulation and manual UI inspection to verify game functionality and centering improvements.

---

## ‚úÖ Successes

### 1. Game Logic (Automated Test)
- **Protagonist Emergence**: Heroes correctly revealed and added to cosmos
- **Installation Construction**: Cards can be played face-down
- **Installation Reveal**: Cards flip face-up correctly
- **Cosmic Attraction**: Heroes correctly attracted based on treasure counts
- **Trial Execution**: Damage calculation works correctly
  - Example: Heroes with 3-6 HP defeated by installations with combined damage
  - Epic heroes award 2 trials/failures vs 1 for normal heroes
- **Scoring System**: Cosmic trials and failures tracked correctly
  - Test result: P1 (6 trials, 0 failures) vs P2 (1 trials, 1 failures)

### 2. UI Centering (Visual Inspection)
- **Player Areas**: ‚úÖ Horizontally centered on game board
  - Boss card + installation slots properly aligned
  - Calculated based on max lair width (4 cards = boss + 3 installations)
- **Hand Cards**: ‚úÖ Appear centered below/above lair areas
- **Inquisitor Panel**: ‚úÖ Centered at top with proper cosmic styling
- **Phase Indicator**: ‚úÖ Displaying correctly in left UI panel

### 3. Visual Design
- **Card Colors**: Correctly mapped by treasure type
  - Science: Green (#4CAF50)
  - Dramatic: Orange (#FF9800)
  - Corporate: Blue (#2196F3)
  - Government: Purple (#9C27B0)
  - Heroes: Red (#F44336)
- **Boss Cards**: Displaying with proper colors
- **Cosmic Theme**: Purple borders and glows look good

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Pass Button Behavior (Minor)
- **Severity**: Low
- **Description**: In automated test, both players "passed" but installations were still present
- **Location**: game.html:819-829 (`playerPass` function)
- **Expected**: Pass should skip placing a card that turn
- **Observed**: Works correctly, but log message could be clearer
- **Status**: Investigate further during manual testing

### Issue #2: AI Decision Making (Enhancement)
- **Severity**: Low (enhancement)
- **Description**: AI always plays random cards without strategy
- **Location**: game.html:630-684 (AIPlayer class)
- **Current**: Selects best card by simple damage + treasure score
- **Suggestion**: Could consider treasure type matching for better attraction
- **Status**: Works for testing, enhancement for later

### Issue #3: Hero/Trial Area Dynamic Centering
- **Severity**: Low
- **Description**: Hero and trial areas should recalculate center on each render
- **Location**: game.html:1187-1219 (renderHeroes and renderTrials functions)
- **Implementation**: ‚úÖ Already implemented with dynamic centering
- **Status**: Need to verify with actual gameplay

### Issue #4: Hand Card Centering Offset
- **Severity**: Low
- **Description**: Hand cards use hardcoded offset calculation
- **Location**: game.html:1156 (`handOffsetX` calculation)
- **Current**: `const handOffsetX = -handWidth / 2 + (2 * (CARD_WIDTH + 10));`
- **Issue**: The `+ (2 * (CARD_WIDTH + 10))` offset may not align perfectly with all hand sizes
- **Status**: Verify during gameplay with varying hand sizes

## üîç Items to Verify with Manual Testing

### Phase Transitions
1. [ ] Click "Next Phase" from PROTAGONIST_EMERGENCE
   - Should reveal 2 heroes centered in middle
   - Should draw 1 card per player
   - Should advance to INSTALLATION_CONSTRUCTION

2. [ ] During INSTALLATION_CONSTRUCTION
   - Click a hand card as Player 1
   - Should place card face-down in lair
   - Should advance to Player 2 (AI should auto-play)
   - Click "Pass" to end building phase

3. [ ] During COSMIC_ATTRACTION
   - Heroes should move to show which player they're attracted to
   - Should automatically advance to TRIAL_EXECUTION

4. [ ] During TRIAL_EXECUTION
   - Should show damage calculations visually
   - Should update scores
   - Should remove defeated heroes

5. [ ] End of Turn (COSMIC_EVALUATION)
   - Should reset for next turn
   - Turn counter should increment

### Centering Verification
1. [ ] Heroes with different counts (1, 2, 3+) should center correctly
2. [ ] Trial cards should center correctly
3. [ ] Hand cards should stay aligned as hand size changes (5, 4, 3, etc.)
4. [ ] Installations should remain centered as they're added (0, 1, 2, 3)

### Edge Cases
1. [ ] Empty hero deck - what happens?
2. [ ] Empty installation deck - what happens?
3. [ ] Victory condition (10 trials or 5 failures)
4. [ ] Both players pass immediately (no installations)
