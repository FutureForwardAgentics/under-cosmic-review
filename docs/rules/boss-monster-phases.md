# Boss Monster Game Phases

## How to Win
- **Win the game:** Be the first player to collect 10 Souls at the end of any turn
- **Lose the game:** Get 5 Wounds at the end of any turn

## The 5 Phases (In Order)

### Phase 1: Beginning of Turn
**What happens automatically:**
- Reveal one Hero card for each player in the game
- Each player draws one Room card from the deck

**What players CAN do:**
- Nothing - just watch and draw

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play Spell cards
- Use Room abilities
- Build anything

---

### Phase 2: Build Phase
**What players CAN do:**
- Build exactly one Room card (optional - you can skip if you want)
- Place the Room face-down to the left of your other rooms, OR place it on top of an existing room to upgrade
- Play Spell cards that have the Build icon (hammer symbol)
- Use Room abilities that have the Build icon (hammer symbol)

**Turn order:**
- Players take turns based on XP (highest XP goes first)
- Each player places their room face-down
- After everyone is done, flip all new rooms face-up at the same time

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Build more than one Room per turn
- Play Spells without the Build icon

---

### Phase 3: Bait Phase
**What happens automatically:**
- Each Hero looks at all the dungeons
- Each Hero goes to the entrance of the dungeon with the most matching Treasure icons
- If there's a tie, or nobody has that Treasure type, the Hero stays in town (doesn't go anywhere)

**What players CAN do:**
- Watch the Heroes move to dungeons

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play any Spell cards
- Use any abilities
- Influence where Heroes go (it's automatic based on Treasure)

---

### Phase 4: Adventure Phase
**What happens:**
- Each Hero walks through the dungeon they entered
- The Hero takes damage from every Room in the dungeon (left to right)
- Compare the Hero's Health to the total damage:
  - If damage is equal to or more than Health: The Hero dies and becomes a Soul (good for you!)
  - If damage is less than Health: The Hero survives and becomes a Wound (bad for you!)

**Turn order:**
- Players take turns based on XP (highest XP goes first)
- When it's your turn, you process all the Heroes at your dungeon entrance

**What players CAN do:**
- Play Spell cards that have the Adventure icon (axe symbol)
- Use Room abilities that have the Adventure icon (axe symbol)

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play Spells without the Adventure icon
- Change the order Heroes go through your dungeon

---

### Phase 5: End of Turn
**What happens automatically:**
- All "until end of turn" effects stop working
- Any deactivated (sideways) rooms turn back upright
- Check if anyone won or lost the game
- If the game isn't over, start a new turn at Phase 1

**What players CAN do:**
- Nothing - just clean up and get ready for the next turn

**What players CANNOT do:**
- Play Spell cards
- Use abilities

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Can Build? | Can Play Spells? | Can Use Abilities? |
|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Beginning of Turn | No | No | No |
| 2. Build Phase | Yes (1 room) | Yes (Build icon only) | Yes (Build icon only) |
| 3. Bait Phase | No | No | No |
| 4. Adventure Phase | No | Yes (Adventure icon only) | Yes (Adventure icon only) |
| 5. End of Turn | No | No | No |

## Important Notes

**XP Order:** In phases where turn order matters (Build and Adventure), the player with the highest XP value goes first. If there's a tie, the tied players decide among themselves who goes first.

**Spell Icons:**
- Hammer icon = can use during Build Phase
- Axe icon = can use during Adventure Phase

**Room Abilities:** Follow the same icon rules as Spells

**Ties in Bait Phase:** If two players have the same Treasure value, the Hero doesn't move to either dungeon - it stays in town.
